# The Journey Continues

This is a second example chapter. Replace it with your own content.

You can organize chapters into **arcs** by adding an `arcs` section to your story's `config.yaml`:

```yaml
arcs:
  - name: "Arc 1: Beginnings"
    chapters:
      - chapter-1
      - chapter-2
```

See the generator `README.md` for the full list of configuration options.
